npm install @0xsplits/splits-sdk
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://docs.splits.org/sdk)

### Viem vs Ethers

The Splits SDK uses Viem under the hood. There is an older version of the SDK that uses ethers-v5.
If you would like to use that instead, you can install it with:

```bash
yarn add @0xsplits/splits-sdk@2

npm install @0xsplits/splits-sdk@2
```

Documentation for the old Ethers version can be found [here](https://docs.splits.org/sdk-v2)
